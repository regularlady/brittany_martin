<p>You've found my collection of past and upcoming public speaking engagements. A good speaker always has their audience's best interest at heart. My goal is to educate, inspire, motivate and entertain. If you have an upcoming conference or meetup that you think I would be a good fit for, please contact me.</p>

		<h3>I'm Altering the Deal</h3>
		<h4>ParisRB 2020</h4>
		<p>Imagine your legacy production Ruby application is highly dependent on a third-party API as you learn your vendor deprecates your current connection. What do you do when you're forced to make a change? Accept the challenge by embracing abstractions, switching libraries, feature flags, edge-case testing while developing new features. Game on.</p>

		<h3>Hire Me: I'm Excellent At Quitting</h3>
		<h4>Rubyconf 2019</h4>
		<p>You have the right to be happy at work â€” why would we want it to be any other way? As our careers as Ruby developers flourish, amazing new opportunities will require you to quit a job that you may love or loathe. It's OK to quit. If you want to learn how to gracefully leave your job with a solid game plan, an educated successor, and without burning bridges, this talk is for you.</p>

		<h3>Draw A Crowd</h3>
		<h4>Isle of Ruby 2018 | Railsconf 2018</h4>
		<p>Contextual Camouflage is an open-source gallery art installation built in RoR that guides visitors to anonymously report mental health disorders that affect themselves or their relationships. After users submit a disorder, they have the option to include anecdotes and demographic data for intervention researchers. The data is molded into an interactive real-time display using ActionCable. Come see how code can double as art and an educational tool.</p>
