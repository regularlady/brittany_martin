					<h3>Ruby Tapas | Serverless Ruby with AWS Lambda</h3>
				</header>
				<p>For some software applications, even a microservice architecture feels too heavyweight. Sometimes all you really need to implement a bit of new functionality is a single function that takes some inputs and produces some outputs. In those cases, wouldn’t it be nice to simply upload the function into the cloud, and let someone else worry about triggering and scaling it? That’s the value proposition of so-called “serverless” computing. In today’s episode, guest chef Brittany Martin is going to show you everything you need to know to get started with serverless architecture in Ruby, using Amazon’s Lambda service. </p>
