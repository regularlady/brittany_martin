Brittany was born and raised in a suburb of Pittsburgh, PA. Post undergrad, she worked at a marketing agency for several years before moving into Product Management.

Brittany moved to San Francisco for two years, becoming a software developer in the process. Since Brittany has returned to Pittsburgh, she has organized events focused on her ambition of bringing more women into tech (Railsbridge Pittsburgh, Clojurebridge Pittsburgh and Startup Weekend Pittsburgh: Womenâ€™s Edition). She is employed at TextUs, a business-class, two-way, text messaging technology built specifically for inside-sales, staffing and recruiting teams as their Backend Engineering Lead. In 2017, she was honored as one of the Incline's "Who's Next in Technology" in Pittsburgh.  

Brittany's education includes a Marketing degree from the University of Pittsburgh, an MBA from Robert Morris University and an apprenticeship with Bloc. Her favorite books are The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg, The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz and the Dark Tower Series by Stephen King.

By night, she plays roller derby for Youngstown's Little Steel Derby Girls under her alter-ego, Norma Skates. She is their current president. She is the host of the Ruby on Rails podcast on the 5 by 5 Network.

She is happy to connect with anyone about switching to a tech career, debating the differences in San Francisco and Pittsburgh's startup community or why her chocolate labrador would be the perfect stunt double for an Alf reboot.
