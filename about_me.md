Brittany was born and raised in a suburb of Pittsburgh, PA. Post undergrad, she worked at a marketing agency for several years before seeking a new challenge. 

Brittany fell in love with startups as a Product Manager and then moved to San Francisco for 2 years, becoming a software developer in the process. Since Brittany has returned to Pittsburgh, she has organized events focused on her ambition of bringing more women into tech (Railsbridge Pittsburgh, Clojurebridge Pittsburgh and Startup Weekend Pittsburgh: Womenâ€™s Edition). She is employed at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, working on the web team that services the majority of the ticketing for the art organizations in the city. In 2017, she was honored as one of the Incline's "Who's Next in Technology" in Pittsburgh.  

Brittany's education includes a Marketing degree from the University of Pittsburgh, an MBA from Robert Morris University and a completed Rails & Frontend apprenticeship with Bloc.io. Her favorite books are The Lean Startup by Eric Ries, The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg, The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz and the Dark Tower Series by Stephen King. 

When she is not coding, she is playing roller derby for Youngstown's Little Steel Derby Girls and bench managing the Pittsburgh Blue Streaks under her alter-ego, Norma Skates. 

She is happy to connect with anyone about switching to a tech career, debating the differences in San Francisco and Pittsburgh's startup community or why she named her dog after the "worst" James bond actor.
